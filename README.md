# xkcd ASCII Viewer
xkcd ASCII Viewer is a simple script that allows you to view daily [xkcd webcomics](https://xkcd.com) as ASCII art directly in your terminal. The idea originated from the fact that visiting xkcd.com always shows a new comic every day. No need to visit the XKCD website â€” simply open your terminal, and enjoy the latest comic in ascii art.

## How It Works
- The script fetches the latest comic from the xkcd website.
- It downloads the image and converts it to ASCII art using `ascii-image-converter` with the following options:
  - `-b`: Removes the background.
  - `-n`: Displays in black and white.
  - `-H 50`: Sets the height of the output to 50 lines.
  - `--threshold 120`: Adjusts the brightness threshold for ASCII conversion.

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure `ascii-image-converter` is installed:
   ```bash
   brew install TheZoraiz/ascii-image-converter/ascii-image-converter
   ```

3. Check if `curl` is installed:
